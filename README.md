# MathematicsQuiz

  Basic Java Program 
  
  I created this project for a family friend who is a teacher at a pre-k and elementary school. I was eager to try and find a real world 
  application for my coding skills, and this was it. My client wanted a program that generated a simple mathematics quiz with random 
  questions and answers for her students without having to calculate all of the answers in her own time. My program allows her to create 
  quizzes and get the answers immediately. This project was completed early in my java years so I didn't put much thought into time and 
  space complexity; however, the design is quite flexible as I could add different types of questions for the future.
